Idea: Use StatsModel's Quantile regression as an alternative to Ransac from
Sci-kit learn.

I found that QuantRegr did not converge with default parameters, because
it throws a warning: "Converge cycle detected."

Note that the same warning is on the example page for the function, which can
be found my searching "statsmodel quantile regression convergence warning"

So I'm going to use just ransac, at least for now.
